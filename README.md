# sct - Semiconductor Company Timeline

An attempt to create a family tree of sorts of semiconductor company mergers/acquisitions/spin offs/divestitures.

Currently using `gnuclad` to generate the timeline. Searching for better options, as `gnuclad` is designed to generate cladograms and semiconductor companies have considerably more mergers/acquisitions and thus the cladogram doesn't look so great. Please let me know if there are better options.

Inspired by Linux Distribution Timeline cladogram, [jappeace/distrowatch1graph1svg](https://github.com/jappeace/distrowatch1graph1svg), and [FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline](https://github.com/FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline)

## CONTRIBUTING

## INSTALLATION/BUILD

#### Installing gnuclad 

To be continued.

#### Creating the cladogram

It's as easy as running `gnuclad` on the CSV file with the options file.

```
gnuclad sct.csv SVG sct.conf
```
